# DevOps Audit Hub 

**Azure DevOps extension for team productivity monitoring, commit analytics, and anomaly detection.**

This repository contains a React + TypeScript Azure DevOps hub extension that runs inside the Azure DevOps web experience and provides a dashboard for tracking developer activity, work items, pull requests, and anomalous behavior.

---

## Key Features

- Team and developer productivity dashboards
- Commit, pull request, and work item trend analysis
- Drill-down developer view with charts and activity summaries
- Anomaly detection for unusual work item, commit, or PR behavior
- Azure DevOps Extension SDK integration for in-host rendering
- Vite-powered React application with TypeScript support

## Technology Stack

- React 19
- TypeScript 6
- Vite 8
- Azure DevOps Extension SDK
- Azure DevOps Node API
- Recharts for charts and visual reporting
- ESLint for code quality

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20 or newer
- npm installed
- Azure DevOps organization and project access
- Browser session authenticated with Azure DevOps
- (Optional) `tfx` CLI installed for packaging the extension

## System Overview

This system is a React + TypeScript Azure DevOps extension that runs inside the Azure DevOps web experience. It collects team-level and developer-level activity data, generates productivity and trend metrics, and surfaces potential anomalies in commits, pull requests, and work item activity.

## Methodology and Steps

1. Initialize the Azure DevOps Extension SDK.
2. Authenticate the current Azure DevOps user session.
3. Load the target team and project context from Azure DevOps.
4. Fetch activity data from Azure DevOps APIs:
   - work items
   - git commits
   - pull requests
   - team and user details
5. Aggregate and normalize the collected data by developer and time range.
6. Calculate productivity metrics and trend summaries.
7. Apply anomaly detection rules to detect unusual or unexpected activity.
8. Render the results in an interactive dashboard with charts and detailed developer views.

## What This System Does

- Loads inside Azure DevOps as a hub extension
- Reads Azure DevOps work item, commit, and pull request data
- Computes team productivity metrics and developer activity summaries
- Detects anomalous behavior using anomaly scoring rules
- Displays dashboards, charts, and drill-down views for teams and individual developers

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MohamedYaseenK/DevOps-Audit-Hub-Azure-DevOps-Extension.git
cd ado-devops-hub
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

> Note: When running locally, Azure DevOps extension authentication may require the app to be hosted through the Azure DevOps preview experience or a secure proxy.

## Build

Compile and bundle the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Output is generated in the `dist/` folder.

## Linting

Run ESLint across the repository:

```bash
npm run lint
```

## Packaging the Azure DevOps Extension

The extension manifest is defined in `vss-extension.json`, and the packaged extension includes the `dist` output and `images` assets.

1. Build the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

2. Package the extension with the Azure DevOps packaging CLI:

```bash
tfx extension create --manifest-globs vss-extension.json
```

3. Publish the generated `.vsix` file to your Azure DevOps organization or use it for local testing.

## Manifest Details

The extension manifest in `vss-extension.json` defines:

- `id`: `devops-hub-for-bluescope`
- `name`: `DevOps Hub for Bluescope`
- `publisher`: `MohamedYaseen`
- `version`: `1.3.1`
- `description`: Developer productivity monitoring hub for Azure DevOps
- `targets`: `Microsoft.VisualStudio.Services`
- `scopes`: `vso.project`, `vso.code`, `vso.work`
- Contribution type: `ms.vss-web.hub`
- Hub target: `ms.vss-work-web.work-hub-group`
- Entry point: `dist/index.html`

## Project Structure

- `src/main.tsx` — initializes the Azure DevOps Extension SDK and renders the React app
- `src/App.tsx` — top-level application shell and routing logic
- `src/components/TeamView.tsx` — team dashboard, metrics, and anomaly detection logic
- `src/components/DeveloperView.tsx` — developer profile view, commits, PRs, and work item details
- `src/api/adoApi.ts` — Azure DevOps REST API calls for commits, PRs, work items, and team data
- `src/anomaly/detector.ts` — anomaly detection rules and scoring logic
- `vss-extension.json` — Azure DevOps extension manifest
- `package.json` — npm scripts and dependencies

## How It Works

- The extension loads inside Azure DevOps as a web hub contribution.
- It calls Azure DevOps APIs to fetch team members, git commits, pull requests, and work items.
- The UI aggregates activity data per developer and computes anomaly signals.
- Users can filter by time range and inspect developer-level activity.

## Notes and Recommendations

- Work item effort is expected under `Microsoft.VSTS.Scheduling.Effort`; custom fields may require updates.
- The current implementation is built for a single team/project context.
- Use `npm run build` before packaging to ensure the latest code is included.
- The local experience may require serving through the Azure DevOps extension host for SDK authentication.

## Suggested Improvements

- Add configuration for custom ADO field names and team definitions
- Improve anomaly detection with adjustable thresholds and historical baselines
- Add multi-project or multi-team reporting support
- Add automated packaging and CI/CD publishing workflows
